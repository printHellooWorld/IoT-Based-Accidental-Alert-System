Description: 
• A novel accident alerting system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller, Arduino UNO, RF transmitter and receiver, solar panel, battery, audio playback module, and storage module, ensuring proactive hazard warnings for drivers.
• When a vehicle enters a danger zone, the RF transmitter signals the RF receiver in the car, activating the audio playback module with a customized warning message. 
• Additionally, integration with the Blynk app sends instant notifications to the driver's phone.
• This system surpasses traditional warning methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for enhanced road safety.
